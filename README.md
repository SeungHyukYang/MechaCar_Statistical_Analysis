## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. The variables that provided a non-random amount of variance are vehicle length and ground clearance 
2. The slope of linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value of 5.35e-11 is smaller than significance level of 0.05% and thus reject the null hypothesis.

3. R squared value of 0.71 is sufficient enough to considered the effectivness of linear regression where the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable by 70%.
